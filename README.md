## Introduction

Eclipse 3D Model is an open-source 3D web application designed to help young learners understand the mechanics of eclipses, including eclipse seasons, why eclipses occur, and why only some people on Earth can see an eclipse at a given time. This project was created as part of the NASA Space App Challenge held at Habib University Karachi on October 7th and 8th.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide an interactive and educational tool for explaining the concept of eclipses. The 3D web application utilizes the three.js library for 3D development to visually demonstrate different types of eclipses, including the shadow effects of the Earth and the Moon. Users can explore the various aspects of eclipses in a fun and engaging way.

## Features

- Interactive 3D models of the Earth, Moon, and Sun.
- Realistic shadow effects to illustrate eclipse mechanics.
- Educational content to explain eclipse types and why they occur.
- User-friendly interface for young learners.
